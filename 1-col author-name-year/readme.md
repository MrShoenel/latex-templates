# One-column Assignment with author-name-year cite-style

An updated version of the IS, IT, OS, ICT template, that mainly makes improvements to the structure and adds jump-links, as well as a question-answer type of template. It is not specific to IS, IT, OS, ICT, but rather a more generic assignment-style template.

This kind of citation style is also useful for writing template-less manuscripts, as it is a minimal template that can be easily switched over to a conference- or journal-specific template using, e.g., the bracket citation style.
